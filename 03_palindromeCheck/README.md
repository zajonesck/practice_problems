## Palindrome Check

A string is a palindrome when its reverse is exactly equal to its original form. For example, “madam” is a palindrome string because its original and reverse are exactly the same. Similarly, “car” is not a palindrome because its reverse (“rac”) is not the same as its original value.

Write a function that takes in a string value and returns whether the string is a palindrome or not.

As always, write tests for the function and think of any possible edge cases. For example, how will you handle an empty string being passed in?
