## Remove Duplicates From An Array

Write a function that takes in an array that may contain any number of duplicates and returns a new array with all duplicate elements removed.

For example the following can be input:
`[1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 1, 4, 5]`

The output after removing duplicates should be:
`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
