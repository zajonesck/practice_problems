PROMPT: Create a function to find and return the duplicate item in an array. For example, ["carrots", "apples", "hotdogs", "apples"] should return "apples".
Think through edges cases you might encounter. Start with the assumption that there will only be one duplicate in the array. Bonus points for solving for multiple duplicates in the array.
